- In Java, data types specify the size and type of values that can be stored in variables.
- Java provides two categories of data types: 
        - primitive data types 
        - reference data types

Primitive Data Types:

Integer Types:

- byte: 8-bit signed integer (-128 to 127)
- short: 16-bit signed integer (-32,768 to 32,767)
- int: 32-bit signed integer (-2^31 to 2^31 - 1)
- long: 64-bit signed integer (-2^63 to 2^63 - 1)

Floating-Point Types:

- float: 32-bit floating-point number
- double: 64-bit floating-point number

Boolean Type:

- boolean: Represents true or false values
- Character Type:

char: 16-bit Unicode character (0 to 65,535)
